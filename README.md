# Assignment A4 - Web Component Framework

## Snake App: [Vercel](https://a4-ian-wright.vercel.app)

This is a port of my Snake Application from Assignment 2/3. The interesting part
of this was porting to NextJS and the App Router, using Server Components for rendering
and Server Actions for mutations. The way you play remains the same - you use WASD
or the arrow-keys. The goal is to let users play Snake, and allow them to keep track
of their high scores. I did not face any serious challenges during this process.
I used AuthJS with GitHub for Authentication. In hindsight, I wish I had implemented
my own Auth with OAuth as this is a relatively simple task and AuthJS has some
strange quirks (it creates some random routes for you that you may not want).
I used _TailwindCSS_ because it allowed me to keep most of my A2 client styling and
logic mostly the same. The only override I made for Tailwind was to change the
font to Vercel Geist.
